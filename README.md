======================================================================================================================================

I'm a passionate Python developer. I believe in continuous learning and continuous improvement. I'm super motivated and highly ambitious. 

Currently I'm collaborating with Asociatia oportnuitati si Cariere as a Python developer with a focus on scraping and backend development.

Technologies:

 - Python, html, css, javascript
 - Django, Django Rest Framework
 - Celery, rabbitmq
 - Docker
 - BeautifullSoup, Selenium, pytest
 - git and github.

I've always been competitive, I aspire to be the best, and I enjoy learning, working hard, and drawing inspiration from high-performance sports.

Here on Github, I post most of my work, so check it out, and maybe you find it cool and want to collaborate.
