Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Cristi Olteanu
======================================================================================================================================

After a few years of honing my communication skills by working in sales, I transitioned to a career in tech, something I've desired for a long time because I am passionate about technology and programming.

I started with Python and libraries like BeautifulSoup, Selenium, pytest, and the Django framework, but I'm also expanding my knowledge to other technologies. I've used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my personal projects, and currently, I'm undergoing Java training.

I've always been competitive, I aspire to be the best, and I enjoy learning, working hard, and drawing inspiration from high-performance sports.

Here on Github, I post most of my work, so check it out, and maybe you find it cool and want to collaborate.
